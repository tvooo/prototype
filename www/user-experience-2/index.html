                <p>I wrote my first program by the age of 9. In school, I always have been attracted by natural sciences instead of languages or sociology. And when I started to study computer science (B.Sc.), my father was pretty sure I would do the Master’s and a PhD afterwards. However, <strong>I</strong> was pretty sure that I’d never wanted to do that. I wanted to work and create, not to research. How boring would <em>that</em> be?</p>
<p>Of course, I couldn’t know of my growing interest in human-computer interfaces and interactions back then. I understood computers, and I knew how to work with them. Most programs I use the first time, I understand from scratch. The same is valid for websites. But for most people this is a lot harder, and it took me a while to realize that.</p>
<p>Creating user interfaces is not about making the user suitable for the system, but the other way round. To know what your user needs, you have to do research. And for all of my luck, it’s not the boring kind of research. It is talking to people, getting to know their desires and beliefs, observing them, and listening to them. It is exciting and most interesting, really.</p>
<p>If you are new to HCI, UX, IxD (or whatever you might call it) and don’t believe me: There is an online course by Stanford Associate Professor Scott Klemmer, “Human-Computer Interaction”, <a href="http://www.hci-class.org">here on Coursera</a>. There you get the chance to practice HCI research, as long as you take it seriously and are willing to spend a little time on it.</p>
