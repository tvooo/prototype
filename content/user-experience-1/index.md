Title: What is it about User Experience, anyway? Information Architecture!

In the following weeks, I will post a few really short stories to explain what makes up User Experience Design, how I got in touch with it, and what fascinates me so much about it.

## Part 1: Information Architecture

When I applied for the final internship of my Bachelor's studies, the one I had to write my thesis about, I got an interview with a very promising development team. The product they created was a Software-as-a-Service, a cloud software, and they told me they had many opportunities for me to work on it.

When the interviewer asked what field I would like best to work in, my answer was *"User Interface and User Experience"*. Back then, I had just discovered that I was not happy with being a software developer alone, and I found that working with user interfaces added a more interesting level to my profession.

The interviewer asked me, *"What is your idea of User Experience? What is the difference to User Interface?"*. I don't remember what I answered to that. Honestly, I am pretty sure that I didn't really answer the question at all. What I **do** remember, though, is that I thought about an answer later on.

*"There is more to a good User Experience than just a good UI. If the data model of an application makes no sense to me and does not fit my task, it is bad User Experience. And this is nothing you can **see** in the UI."*

Half a year later I have learnt a lot more on these topics. Now I know: what I described to myself back then was correct, although it was just one example of many. The __Information Architecture__ defines the way information are structured in a software product. It includes a terminology the user understands, and it guides the user through the different areas of the software with a clear navigation. A meaningful Information Architecture is part of a good User Experience.
