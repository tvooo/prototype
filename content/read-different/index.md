Title: Don’t read more, read different
Date: 2013-12-31

Holidays—having the time off from work and studies made me realize how much I missed a good novel. I finally have time to catch up with my to-read list.

Reading is great. It informs, educates, and entertains. It sparks your creativity. It teaches you words, phrases, and style. It makes you a better writer. *”I really should read more,”* was my thought. *”This will be my New Year’s resolution.”*

But thinking about it, I actually read **a lot.** I don’t need to take the time—I already do. Here are some of the places and media that I use to read, both online and offline:

- **Personal Email**, which includes both private and business conversations.
- **Newsletters**, mostly job-related; for example Sidebar, the Smashing Magazine Newsletter, JS Weekly, and SMACSS.
- **Articles** on the web are saved to *Pinboard* and read with *Paperback*, a read-it-later web client for Pinboard similar to Pocket, Readability, or Instapaper.
- **Documentation** for software, such as API documentations.
- As a developer I read a lot of **code**.
- I check four **news websites** on a regular basis: *Süddeutsche*, *Zeit* (both German), *Sydsvenskan* (Swedish), and the *Guardian* (English).
- **Magazines**, for example the great *Offscreen Magazine* and the occasional *Wired*.
- **Books** that I want to read are managed in my To Do list application, both fiction and non-fiction. I read paperback books as well as on my Kindle.
- Several **social media** portals, such as *Facebook*, *Twitter*, and *Google+*.
- (Although I tried it a few times, I never got used to using an RSS reader.)

The bare amount of readings and the way I organize them is the real problem. There are two facts that I noticed that make reading difficult for me. **edit**

First, reading is an important activity in both my personal and my professional life. Sometimes, it is easy to tell where a certain text belongs; I read a novel for personal joy and an API documentation for work. But at other times it is not that easy to distinguish. I read *Offscreen* in my spare time, and I really enjoy it, but at the same time it is a magazine about my industry, and thus, my work.

Second, I would *never be able* to read all of this. What I do, though, is to filter all my readings beforehand—sometimes consciously, but most of the time unconsciously. This is totally natural and good, but with the bare amount of information we have to process nowadays, it is quite some work in itself. Whenever I get a newsletter, I need to read at least every headline, if not the teaser text, to decide wether or not something is interesting enough for me to read. This pre-filtering process is relevant to nearly every online source I consume.

Rolf Dobelli, author of *The Art of Thinking Clearly*, puts it this way in his article [News is bad for you](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli):

> *“Information is no longer a scarce commodity. But attention is. You are not that irresponsible with your money, reputation or health. Why give away your mind?”*  
> —Rolf Dobelli

Based on this observation, I would like to change my New Year’s Resolution to something more real: don’t read more, but read different.

#### Leisure reading should not be work

If I have books in my to do list, even novels, then I want to read through them as quickly as possible, just to mark them *done*. But this has nothing to do with joyful reading any more.

Readings that I want to do for work and studies—articles, design books—should still be organized in my to do application. After all, it’s work, right?

If I get a recommendation for a book from a friend, or find something myself that I would like to read in my leisure time, it’s different. Regarding those readings, I’d like to trust my memory more. If I find it interesting enough to *keep on mind*, I will remember it, for sure. I don’t need to put it down. If, on the other hand, I forget about it, it’s not a problem either. I have enough to read anyway and I will stumble upon it again, eventually.

#### Spend less time cramming, more time reading

Of all the sources that give me lots of small pieces of information—like Twitter, news sites, newsletters—I first have to get an overview. I need to decide what is interesting to me, and worth reading.

I can make this process easier by reducing several things.

1. Reduce the number of sources that I get information from. Unsubscribe from newsletters and only keep the most relevant ones.
2. Reduce redundancy. I follow a lot of people on both Twitter and Google+, and some even on Facebook, or Tumblr, or their blogs. Also, a lot of news sites and aggregators show me the same news. What a waste of time and attention.
3. Reduce the number of platforms. I have to look in so many different places to get up to date with everything and everyone. Maybe it’s time to try RSS again, even if it’s just for 10 blogs.

The important thing is to not be overwhelmed by the amount of information you process—or, in other words, that you *think you need to process*. Read what is interesting to you. Don’t be afraid to cut things off. Spend less time sorting, filtering, prioritising, and more time *reading*.
